This project implements a **synchronous FIFO** with 3 entries and 8-bit width using Verilog. It supports write (`wr_en`) and read (`rd_en`) operations, with `full` and `empty` flags for status indication. Internally, it uses a memory array, read/write pointers, and a counter for tracking the number of stored items. A testbench (`tb_sync_fifo.v`) is included to simulate normal operation, overflow, and underflow conditions.
